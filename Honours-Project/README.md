# **Currently Ongoing Module**
Game Development Masterclass:

Indie game development demands a portfolio of skills beyond those of isolated design and
technicality. This form of game development requires that developers are able to build a
sustainable business with consideration for the promotion of their game, and for post-launch
development and support.  
Working in small teams, students will develop a high quality polished prototype, identifying the
genre, supporting technology, and intended platform. In the first instance, students must clearly
identify their nominated target audience, and present robust and convincing evidence of a
detailed competitor analysis.  
Students must identify the USP of their proposed project, demonstrating creativity and innovation, 
and explaining how their proposed project will stand out in a crowded marketplace.  
With the preparatory research in place, students will construct a list
of design pillars which will inform and guide design choices throughout development.  
Teams will adopt an Agile management methodology, drawing upon the experience they have
acquired in previous modules to scope, plan, assess, and moderate their progress.  
Throughout this module, students will develop an understanding of the importance of building an
early business case for their proposed game, and of the various potential markets, platforms,
and monetisation strategies at their disposal.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:  
On successful completion of this module, a student will be able to:  
1. Demonstrate the ability to develop a high quality game for a specified audience.  
2. Communicate consistent progress throughout the iterative development cycle.  
3. Demonstrate a critical awareness of how the various elements of the game development
process influence each other.  
4. Create a detailed plan for promoting, supporting, and monetising a game.

## ASSESSMENT 1: Completed Game  
This submission will take the form of the completed game. The game will be assessed for its
experiential value, originality, level of polish, and ability to meet the requirements of the target
audience. All aspects of the game will be assessed, including code, visual design, sound
design, and gameplay design components. Multiple development iterations and iterative
evaluation of stakeholder feedback will ensure that the game is of a high standard. Where the
game is undertaken as part of a team, each student receives the same mark for this component
of the assessment.

DELIVERABLES:  
A playable game build of at least thirty minutes of gameplay

## ASSESSMENT 2: Individual Contributions  
During weekly progress meetings, contributions from each student will be monitored and
evaluated in order to provide individual formative feedback. These contributions will be collated
and submitted by each student on an individual basis.

DELIVERABLES:  
A comprehensive asset list of personal contributions  
A video of gameplay with voice over indicating personal contribution to development,
and impact on the final product

## ASSESSMENT 3: Promotional and Support Plan (2000 words)  
Each student will construct their own individual promotional and support plan for the game. This
will be informed by the module content delivered throughout the module, and the weekly
formative feedback provided to each student and group. The majority of this work will be
conducted in Games Hub sessions.

DELIVERABLES:  
A one-page marketing plan  
A business canvas  
Release schedule / production plan outlining the schedule beyond the module deadline
and Tranzfuser deadlines  
A one-minute game trailer  
Social media and marketing presence, and branding resources (e.g. company logo,
social media banners etc)
