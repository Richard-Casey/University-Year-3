This repository contains my final-year submission for the **Professional Practice** module at the University of Suffolk. The project focused on delivering a real-world solution to a live brief set by an external client. My role involved designing and implementing a secure authentication system using Unity and MongoDB, with JWT token-based login and refresh support.
